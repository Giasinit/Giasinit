Hi, I'm Giasin
==============

> I am a young programmer, and I dream of becoming an entrepreneur one day... or maybe I already am.

Background
----------

I'm not great at school, or at least I don't enjoy other subjects besides computer science. I never have time to read a book, so I get my knowledge from other sources. I don't sleep much because I know that by making sacrifices, I'll get somewhere.

Programming Languages
---------------------

*   **PHP** 🐘: I primarily program in PHP, which is a web programming language, but I also use it for simple calculations. Let's say it's the best for the backend, in my opinion.
*   **HTML & CSS** 🌐: I know HTML & CSS, which are not programming languages but rather markup languages. These two have helped me a lot. I started with a simple HTML file and a stylesheet.
*   **Python** 🐍: I don't know Python, and many people tell me it's easy and simple, but I just can't seem to get it.
*   **Node.js and React.js** 🟢🔵: I'm good at Node.js and React.js. I have experience with JavaScript in general, and I prefer JavaScript over Java.
*   **Lua** 🎮: I started with Lua for games. Lua is a programming language created for games, and I used it for FiveM.
*   **React Native** 📱: I've recently started creating apps with React Native, and it's awesome.

-------

I opened [GiaFlix](https://www.giaflix.it/), which is difficult to describe, but it's like a hub of projects, a collection of projects that no one usually looks at. Many people say it's a waste of time, but they don't know that my clients usually see it first 😃

Interests
---------

My interests are varied, from volunteering to using my knowledge to help others or for work. 🤝
